# There Was an Old Lady

## Lyrics
There was an old lady who swallowed a fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a bird;<br>
How absurd to swallow a bird!<br>
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;<br>
Imagine that! She swallowed a cat!<br>
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,<br>
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady that swallowed a dog;<br>
What a hog, to swallow a dog!<br>
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,<br>
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,<br>
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a goat;<br>
She just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!<br>
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog,<br>
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,<br>
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,<br>
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cow;<br>
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!<br>
She swallowed the cow to catch the goat,<br>
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog,<br>
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,<br>
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,<br>
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!<br>
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;<br>
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse;<br>
...She died, of course!
