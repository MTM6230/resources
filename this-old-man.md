# This Old Man

## Lyrics
This old man, he played one,<br>
He played knick-knack on my drum;<br>
With a knick-knack paddywhack,<br>
Give a dog a bone,<br>
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played two,<br>
He played knick-knack on my shoe;<br>
With a knick-knack paddywhack,<br>
Give a dog a bone,<br>
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played three,<br>
He played knick-knack on my knee;<br>
With a knick-knack paddywhack,<br>
Give a dog a bone,<br>
This old man came rolling home.
